        <h2>Biography of Jagmeet Singh</h2>
        <p><a href="https://dramawire.studio/jagmeet-singh/">Jagmeet Singh</a> Jimmy Dhaliwal, born on January 2, 1979, in Scarborough, Ontario, is a prominent Canadian politician and the leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP) since 2017. A practicing Sikh of Punjabi descent, Singh is an Indo-Canadian and holds the distinction of being the first Sikh and the first person of a visible minority to lead a major federal political party in Canada. His journey from a criminal defense lawyer to a key figure in Canadian politics is marked by resilience, a commitment to social justice, and a passion for addressing systemic inequalities.</p>
        <p>Singh’s early life was shaped by both opportunity and adversity. Born to Harmeet Kaur, a teacher, and Jagtaran Dhaliwal, a psychiatrist, Singh spent his first year in Punjab, India, with his grandparents while his parents faced financial struggles in Canada. The family later reunited and moved to St. John’s, Newfoundland, and then Windsor, Ontario, where Singh grew up. His childhood was not without challenges; he faced significant racism due to his brown skin, long hair, and unique name, which led to bullying at school. To cope, his parents enrolled him in martial arts, starting with Taekwondo at age nine, and later Aikido, Jiu-Jitsu, and Judo. Singh excelled in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, becoming the undefeated champion in his weight class in the Greater Toronto Area from 2003 to 2007.</p>
        <p>Tragically, at age 10, Singh was sexually abused by his Taekwondo coach, a trauma he disclosed publicly in his 2019 memoir, <em>Love & Courage: My Story of Family, Resilience, and Overcoming the Unexpected</em>. Additionally, his father’s struggle with alcoholism added instability to his upbringing. Despite these hardships, Singh’s mother instilled in him Sikh values of interconnectedness and resilience, which profoundly influenced his worldview. To shield him from further racism, his parents enrolled him in the private Detroit Country Day School in Michigan, where he thrived academically and athletically, captaining the wrestling team.</p>
        <p>Singh pursued higher education at the University of Western Ontario, earning a Bachelor of Science in Biology in 2001, followed by a law degree from Osgoode Hall Law School in 2005. Called to the bar in 2006, he began his career as a criminal defense lawyer in Toronto, working at Pinkofskys before co-founding Singh Law with his brother Gurratan. His legal work focused on social justice, offering pro bono services to marginalized communities and advocating against poverty and inequality. This activism fueled his entry into politics.</p>
        <p>In 2011, Singh ran as an NDP candidate in the federal election for Bramalea—Gore—Malton but lost narrowly to the Conservative opponent. Undeterred, he contested the provincial election in the same riding later that year, winning a seat in the Ontario Legislative Assembly as the first NDP Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for Peel Region. He served as MPP from 2011 to 2017 and became the deputy leader of the Ontario NDP in 2015 under Andrea Horwath. His work in the legislature included advocating for an end to police carding—a practice he experienced personally—and securing fairer auto insurance rates.</p>
        <p>In 2017, Singh won the federal NDP leadership race on the first ballot with 53.8% of the vote, succeeding Tom Mulcair. His leadership marked a historic moment, as he became the first non-White leader of a major Canadian federal party. As the MP for Burnaby South from 2019 to 2025, Singh pushed for progressive policies, including pharmacare, dental care for low-income Canadians, and climate action. His confidence-and-supply agreement with the Liberal Party in 2022 ensured these priorities were advanced, though it drew criticism from Conservatives who accused him of propping up the Trudeau government for personal gain, such as securing his parliamentary pension.</p>
        <p>Singh’s personal life reflects his vibrant personality and cultural pride. Known for his sharp fashion sense, featuring colorful turbans and tailored suits, he has been recognized by media like GQ for his style, which he uses to challenge stereotypes. An avid cyclist with six designer bicycles, Singh is also fluent in English, French, Punjabi, and Hindi, and plays the guitar and tabla. In 2018, he married Gurkiran Kaur Sidhu, a fashion designer and co-founder of the Punjabi clothing line Jangiiro. The couple welcomed their daughter, Anhad, in 2022.</p>
        <p>Politically, Singh identifies as a progressive and social democrat, advocating for a $15/hour minimum wage, progressive taxation, LGBTQ rights, and drug decriminalization. His stance on international issues, such as calling for an end to arms sales to Israel and recognizing Palestine, has sparked debate, as has his pro-Khalistani sympathies, which led to India denying him a visa in 2013. Despite electoral challenges—the NDP lost seats in 2019 and remained the fourth party in 2021—Singh’s leadership is defined by his commitment to fairness and empowering young people. After losing his seat in the 2025 federal election, he announced plans to resign as NDP leader, leaving a legacy as a trailblazer in Canadian politics.</p>
